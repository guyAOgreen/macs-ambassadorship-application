# CourtOS — Plan of Action

## Product Summary

A multitenant SaaS platform for padel tournament management. Organisations (clubs, gym chains) each own their venues and run tournaments. Organisers manage tournaments, Members play across any organisation, and walk-ins join via QR. A kiosk screen at each venue shows live match assignments and leaderboards. Seven tournament formats supported.

## Phase 1 — Foundation

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Scaffold TanStack Start project
- [ ] Configure Convex project (dev + prod)
- [ ] Connect Netlify deployment pipeline
- [ ] Set up TailwindCSS
- [ ] Define environment variables and secrets

### 1.2 Auth (Clerk)
- [ ] Clerk integration — email/password + social OAuth for all platform users
- [ ] Clerk organisation provisioning for tenants (Super Admin creates org via Clerk API)
- [ ] Anonymous auth for walk-in participants (QR-triggered, short-lived token)
- [ ] Role-based access: `super_admin` | `tenant_admin` | `organiser` | `member` | `walk_in`
- [ ] Org context middleware — every request scoped to the active org via Clerk JWT claims

### 1.3 Core Data Model
```
organizations    (id, clerkOrgId, name, slug, status)
users            (id, clerkUserId, name, email)
venues           (id, organizationId, name, court_count)
tournaments      (id, organizationId, venueId, name, format, state, starts_at, ends_at)
participants     (id, tournamentId, userId, entry_type, team_id?)
pairs            (id, tournamentId, participant_a_id, participant_b_id)
teams            (id, tournamentId, name)
rounds           (id, tournamentId, round_number, state)
matches          (id, roundId, court_number, pair_a_id, pair_b_id, state)
scores           (id, matchId, submitted_by, score_a, score_b, state)
leaderboard      (id, tournamentId, participantId, points, wins, losses)
```

## Phase 2 — Tournament Formats

Each format implements two functions:
- `generateRounds(tournament, participants) → Round[]`
- `calculatePoints(match, score) → PointsDelta`

### Format Implementations

| Format | Entry Type | Partner Rotation | Rounds Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Americano | Solo | Every round | All players rotate, points accumulate individually |
| Mexicano | Solo | Based on ranking | Partners assigned by current standing each round |
| Knockout | Pair | Fixed | Single elimination bracket |
| Round Robin | Pair | Fixed | All pairs play each other, points total |
| King of the Court | Solo | Winners stay | Winning pair stays on court, losers rotate out |
| Snakes and Ladders | Pair | Fixed | Round robin + promotion/relegation between courts |
| Team Clash | Team (pairs) | Fixed | Two teams, pairs matched cross-team, team points total |

### Phase 2 Deliverables
- [ ] Format engine interface (shared contract)
- [ ] Americano engine
- [ ] Mexicano engine
- [ ] Knockout bracket generator
- [ ] Round Robin scheduler
- [ ] King of the Court rotation logic
- [ ] Snakes and Ladders court promotion logic
- [ ] Team Clash team points aggregation

---

## Phase 6 — Member PWA

---

## Phase 7 — Kiosk Display

  - Up next: next round matches queued
  - Leaderboard: top N with points
- [ ] Convex reactive queries on `matches`, `scores`, `leaderboard`

- [ ] Audit log for score changes
- [ ] QR code generation for tournaments and individual walk-in registration
- [ ] Export results (PDF/CSV) per tournament
